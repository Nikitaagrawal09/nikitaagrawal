# 👋 Hey there, I’m Nikita Agrawal!

I'm a curious mind with a love for **data**, a knack for storytelling, and a mission to make numbers speak louder than words.  
Currently diving deep into the world of **analytics**, I specialize in turning raw data into clean, clear, and meaningful insights that help businesses grow smarter.

Whether it’s building dashboards, cleaning messy datasets, or designing a visual that simplifies complexity—I’m all in.
